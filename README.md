# Programming language practice
## C/C++
    - Data Structures (C) 
        - Linked List/Dynamic Array
        - queue/dequeue & stack call center
        - queue from stack implementation 
        - BST
        - Heap-based Priority Queue
        - Dijkstra's Algorithm
        - Hashtable based on Dynamic Array's & Linked Lists
